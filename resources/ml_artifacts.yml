  # Vector Search Index
  # Note: Vector search indexes are not supported as direct bundle resources.
  # They must be created and managed separately via the Databricks SDK/API or UI.
  # The index name and endpoint are referenced by variables and used in the training notebook.
  # If bundle support is added in the future, uncomment and update the resource definition below.
